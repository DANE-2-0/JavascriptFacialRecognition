# WHAT WE ARE DOING
### Reason
We created a facial detection model that is able to pick up facial structures using Tensorflow JS. With this, we have been able to start implementing it into other React applications to begin the cration of face id, secuirty features, and more!



# HOW IT WORKS

Run the commands below with Node downloaded along with Tensorflow and React. When this is done, you should be able to begin the download and running of the program we have created. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
